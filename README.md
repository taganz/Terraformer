##Terraformer
###Ecoystem simulator

**Terraformer** is a project to build a free ecosystem simulation videogame.

Educational simulators tends to focus in the theoretical model and forget the user experience. The aim of Terraformer is to build a simple but visually appealing videogame to give students a real experience of the simulation.

In Terraformer you can

- Explore ecosystems in a videogame interface
- Analyze local species competing among them
- Introduce genetically modified invasive species to compete with local population
- Observe evolution of species based on natural selection
- Log data to analyze ecosystem dynamics

Terraformer was built with Unity 4.6
